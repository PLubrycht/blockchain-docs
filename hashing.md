# Understanding Hashing in Bitcoin

## Introduction

Hashing is one of the most fundamental concepts in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. A hash function takes any input — no matter how large or complex — and produces a fixed-length string of characters. Bitcoin uses the cryptographic hash function SHA-256, which always produces a 256-bit output. This property ensures consistency, security, and immutability of data within the network. In Bitcoin, hashing is used for block creation, transaction verification, and ensuring network consensus.
