# Mainnet and Testnet

[TOC]

## 1.Introduction

In blockchain, networks are divided into **mainnet** and **testnet** environments.

* the **mainnet** is the primary blockchain where real transactions with real assets take place;
* the **testnet** is a parallel network for experimentation, where tokens have no real value and developers can test applications without cost and safely.

The division ensures innovation and security without exposing users to unnecessary risk.

## 2.Bitcoin Networks

Bitcoin supports several networks that serve different purposes:

* **Bitcoin mainnet**: the production blockchain where real BTC is transferred and mined;
* **Bitcoin testnet**: an alternative blockchain where coins have no value, used for development and experimentation. Testnet BTC can be obtained from faucets;
* **Bitcoin regtest**: a private, local testing environment where developers can instantly generate blocks and test applications without internet connection.

## 3.Ethereum Networks

Ethereum provides multiple networks as well:

* **Ethereum mainnet**: the production network where real ET is used for transactions, contracts, and dApps;
* **Ethereum testnets**:
  * **Sepolia**: currently the main testnet;
  * **Holesky**: introduced in 2023, designed for large scale testing, staking and stress simulations;
  * **Goerli**: and older testnet being phased out.
  
On testnets, developers can request free ETh from faucets to pay gas fees when deploying contracts or sending transactions.

## 4.Why Testnets Are Important

Testnets provide:

* **safety**: developers can safely test code, upgrades, and smart contracts without affecting the real blockchain or putting real users funds at risk;
* **cost efficiency**: transactions and tests use free tokens, so developers can simulate the mainnet conditions without spending actual money on fees or gas;
* **ecosystem preparation**: before major changes, testnets are used to simulate the upgrade in a safe environment, to provide smooth adaptation to update before it goes live on the mainnet.

## 5.Summary

Mainnets and testnets are key element for blockchain development and innovation. While mainnets ensure the real economy of BTC and ETH, testnets act as laboratories for developers, enabling secure and costless experimentation. Both are essential for the stability and evolution of whole blockchain ecosystem.
